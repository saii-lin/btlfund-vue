                      You can phone your brokerage’s trading line or visit the
                      brokerage.

                    <li>
                      Some firms also offer on-line trading services, which
                      allow orders to be routed into an exchange’s trading
                      system in real time. But if the brokerage’s on-line
                      service is an email-based system, you will only be using
                      the email to place orders that are manually fed into the
                      trading system, so the usual processing delays and human
                      error may apply.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Whichever method you use, it’s important you give accurate
                      instructions. You must clearly give the stock name or
                      stock code, the exact number of shares or the number of
                      board lots you wish to trade, the type of order, and the
                      price level you want.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The type of order determines when and how your order will
                      be executed. If you want price protection, you can use a
                      limit order: this means the transaction takes place at a
                      price equal to or better than the price you specify. If
                      you want your order to be executed immediately, you can
                      place a market order: in this case, the transaction will
                      be executed at the best price available at the time your
                      order reaches the market. Remember that this is what Carl
                      did, and his problem was that he could not control the
                      order price.

                  <p>
                    Ask the person you are dealing with to repeat your
                    instructions to make sure there’s no misunderstanding.

                      A matching order is executed automatically. If there’s no
                      immediate match, your order joins a queue and waits its
                      turn. When it is executed depends on the stock’s liquidity
                      and the&nbsp;spread&nbsp;between your order price and the
                      prevailing market price.

                    <li>
                      Do not assume your order has been filled simply because
                      the stock traded at the price you specified. Other
                      investors’ orders at the same price may be in front of
                      yours – if so, their orders will be matched first.
                      Remember to&nbsp;ask&nbsp;your brokerage to confirm that
                      your trade has been completed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      With on-line trading, you need to distinguish between
                      order confirmation (the order is confirmed but has not
                      been executed) and trade confirmation (an order has been
                      fully or partially filled).
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Do not place another order if you are not sure whether your
                    original order has been executed. Check with your brokerage
                    first. Remember to cancel the original unexecuted order
                    before placing a new one. Otherwise, you may end up either
                    buying twice as many shares as you want or selling shares
                    that you do not own.

                      The pre-opening session adopts an auction mechanism.
                      Orders are accumulated over a certain period and then
                      matched at a single price called the final Indicative
                      Equilibrium Price (IEP). This is the price at which the
                      maximum number of shares can be executed from the matched
                      orders.

                    <li>
                      However, you can place an at-auction order or an
                      at-auction limit order in the pre-opening session. If you
                      want your order to be executed at the final IEP, you can
                      place an <strong>at-auction order</strong> without
                      specifying the price. But if you expect your order to be
                      filled at a particular price or better, use an
                      <strong>at-auction limit order</strong>. And remember that
                      at-auction orders get higher priority than at-auction
                      limit orders when matching takes place.

                    <li>
                      When the pre-opening session ends, any unfilled at-auction
                      orders will be cancelled while at-auction limit orders
                      will be carried forward and queued as limit orders in the
                      morning session.

                    Brokerage commission is freely negotiable between the

                    All brokerages must have an audio system to record client
                    order instructions made by phone. The recordings should be
                    kept for at least six months. Also, the orders should be
                    time-stamped. A brokerage should prohibit its staff members
                    from receiving client order instructions through mobile
                    phones when they are on the trading floor, in the trading
                    room, usual place of business where order is received or
                    usual place where business is conducted. It should have a
                    written policy in place to explain and enforce this
                    prohibition.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, where orders are accepted by mobile phones outside
                    the locations mentioned above, the staff member should
                    immediately call back to the brokerage’s telephone recording
                    system and record the time of receipt and the order details.
                    The use of other formats (e.g. in writing by hand) to record
                    details of clients’ order instructions and time of receipt
                    should only be used if the brokerage’s telephone recording

                    In general, capital re-organization may include a reduction
                    of share capital followed by a share consolidation.
                  </p>
                  <p><em>Share capital reduction</em></p>
                  <p>
                    Often, reducing a listed company’s issued share capital is
                    effected by reducing the par value of each share.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The share capital and reserves of a company tell the net
                    worth of a company. If a company has been operating at
                    losses for sometime, it may have accumulated significant
                    deficits such that the actual value of its assets may be far
                    lower than the value of its issued share capital, therefore,
                    the company may want to reduce its issued share capital so
                    as to give a more realistic picture of its creditworthiness.

                  <p><em>Share consolidation</em></p>
                  <p>
                    A listed company may conduct a share consolidation following
                    the reduction in share capital to raise thepar value of each
                    share. A share consolidation means consolidating a number of
                    shares into a single new share. Sometimes, a company may
                    also change its board lot size for trading on the Stock
                    Exchange. Consolidation of shares decreases the number of
                    authorised shares but proportionally increases the par value
                    of each share. However, it does not affect either the
                    authorized or issued share capital.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since the par value of each share increases proportionally
                    in a share consolidation, there is actually no change in the
                    total par value of the holding of each shareholder.
                  </p>
                  <p><em>Par value vs market value</em></p>
                  <p>
                    It is important to note that the par value and market value
                    of shares are not correlated. The par value is a fixed value
                    predetermined by the company concerned, whereas the market
                    value is a constantly changing value determined by market
                    forces of demand and supply. Practically speaking, it is not
                    possible for the two values to correspond with each other
                    (except when the company has an initial public offering and
                    it can fix the initial offer price), or to change
                    simultaneously.

                    A takeover is when a company or person (bidder) makes an
                    offer to acquire the voting shares of a company (target)
                    with a view to controlling it. In Hong Kong, takeovers of
                    public companies are governed by the Hong Kong Codes on
                    Takeovers and Mergers (Takeovers Code).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the key rules of the Takeovers Code is that a person
                    or group of persons acting together must make a general
                    offer to buy the remaining shares in a company if: (i) it
                    buys 30% or more of voting shares in the company; or (ii) it
                    already holds between 30% and 50% of the voting shares and
                    increases that holding by more than 2% in any 12-month
                    period. This is known as a mandatory general offer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A takeover may also be made by making a voluntary general
                    offer (this happens when there is no obligation to make an
                    offer under the Takeovers Code).
                  </p>
                  <p><em>Takeovers can be conditional</em></p>
                  <p>
                    Normally offers depend on the bidder receiving sufficient
                    acceptances for it to obtain 50% or more of the target’s
                    voting shares. If the bidder doesn’t get the minimum 50%,
                    the offer will lapse. This is the only condition that may be
                    attached to a mandatory offer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If a bidder already holds more than 50% of the voting rights
                    before the offer is made, the offer will normally be
                    unconditional from the outset.

                    Under the Listing Rules, companies listed on the Main Board
                    or Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) must first obtain the
                    specific approval or general mandate given by shareholders
                    (usually at a General Meeting) to the board of directors
                    before they can repurchase their own shares. The Rules also
                    provide for the number of shares, timing and disclosure of
                    repurchases by companies. Shareholders can exercise their
                    voting rights to vote for or against a share repurchase
                    proposal or mandate.

                    Nothing could have affected non-shareholder investors more
                    than the decrease in liquidity of the relevant shares in the
                    market after a share repurchase. According to the supply and
                    demand theory, a fall in supply may stimulate the share
                    price to some extent. However, investors must not overlook
                    other factors, such as the overall sentiment of the stock
                    market, fundamentals of the company itself, which may also
                    affect the performance of the share price.

                    While A, B and H shares are shares issued by SOEs, there
                    exists another important category of China play: the “red
                    chip”. This label describes stocks in companies with
                    business, assets, markets and ownership that have a strong
                    Mainland orientation. Red-chip companies are not
                    incorporated in the Mainland. The par values of their shares
                    are expressed in currencies other than the RMB. There is
                    another important difference between a red-chip company and
                    a SOE listed in Shanghai or Shenzhen: normally, all of the
                    shares in issue in a red chip are tradable (i.e. there is no
                    segmentation of share capital as there is in the SOE). There
                    is no subdivision between “domestic” and “foreign” shares in
                    such companies either.

                    A “settlement instruction” refers to the transfer of
                    securities between two accounts in the Central Clearing And
                    Settlement System (CCASS). The service is usually used in
                    the following circumstances:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      An investor wants to transfer his shares from one
                      brokerage to another for custody.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Holder of an Investor Account in CCASS has to transfer his
                      shares to/from his brokerage for settlement purpose when
                      shares are traded.When a share transfer is made by means
                      of a settlement instruction (SI), the parties to the
                      settlement each have to issue a SI to the CCASS, stating
                      the amount of shares to be transferred and the identity of
                      the parties to the settlement, etc. CCASS will carry out
                      the instruction and transfer the shares to the account of
                      the designated recipient only when the information
                      provided by both parties is matched.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    As a share transfer effected by way of SI is a strictly
                    commercial service, it may not be available at every
                    brokerage, depending on individual company’s policy or other
                    commercial considerations. Furthermore, before giving any
                    SI, investors should find out from the CCASS and their
                    brokerages about the fees charged for effecting a share
                    transfer by this means.

                    Under existing legislation, the shares of listed companies
                    can be freely traded by their holders. Shareholders of
                    listed companies can, therefore, dispose of the shares they

                    At present, investors usually have their listed shares
                    traded through brokerages on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong
                    in search of a better price and to save the trouble of
                    looking for a buyer themselves. In such cases, both the
                    buyer and the seller have to pay commission to their broker,
                    the transaction levy, the trading fee, the investor
                    compensation levy and the ad valorem stamp duty for the

                    If an investor chooses to have his shares traded off the

                    with paying the brokerage. However, they will have to fill
                    in a deed of transfer stating the identity of the transferor
                    (seller) and the transferee (buyer), the name of the stock,
                    the quantity of shares and the transaction value.
                    Furthermore, both the buyer and the seller will have to sign
                    a contract note and pay the ad valorem stamp duty to the
                    Inland Revenue Department (IRD).

                    Investors who want to be protected by Hong Kong laws for
                    their trades in foreign stocks have to make sure that they
                    deal with a properly registered intermediary. Similar to the
                    case of trading local securities, investors who intend to
                    trade foreign stocks have to enter into a client’s agreement
                    with the intermediary whereby the rights and obligations of
                    both trading parties are specified. Investors also have to
                    ensure that they will be issued with a contract note after
                    each transaction and an account statement so that they can
                    have a clear understanding of the account movements.

                    Many listed companies will recommend whether a final
                    dividend will be paid when they announce their annual
                    results. The dividend recommendation is then subject to
                    voting by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting
                    before a listed company officially declares a dividend,
                    meaning that it is possible for the proposed amount of
                    dividend to be changed. Investors buying a stock based on
                    the amount of final dividend recommended but not declared
                    should bear this risk in mind.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Information about the dividend recommended or declared can
                    be found at the share registrars of listed companies or on
                    the website of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.
                    However, you must note that even if the shares with dividend
                    declared are acquired before the dividend payout date, it
                    does not necessarily mean that you will definitely receive
                    the dividend payments.

                  <p>
                    Whether you can get the announced dividend depends on the
                    date on which you acquire the relevant shares. Followings
                    are the important dates you must note:

                    <li>
                      “Book Close Date” refers to the date when a listed company
                      suspends the updating of the Register of Shareholders. If
                      a shareholder is holding physical scrip, the transfer of
                      title procedure must be completed before the book close
                      date so that the shares are registered in the name of the
                      shareholder, otherwise dividend will not be paid to that
                      shareholder.

                    <li>
                      “Ex-Dividend Date” refers to two trading days prior to the
                      first day of the book close date. Investors must acquire
                      the shares before the ex-dividend date in order to be
                      eligible for receiving the dividend payout. The share
                      price will also be adjusted downwards on the ex-dividend
                      date to reflect the impact on the share price as a result
                      of the dividend payout.

                    You place your orders directly to the fund house or your
                    fund agent on any dealing day in person, by phone or through
                    the Internet. Currently, most funds are dealt on a daily or
                    weekly basis. Dealings are mainly on a “forward” basis, i.e.
                    your subscription will be based on the fund’s NAV,
                    calculated when the market closes on that same day. This is
                    seen to be able to ensure that the price you pay accurately
                    reflects the value of the fund on the day the order was
                    placed. Funds that deal on a “historic” basis deal with the
                    fund price based on the previous valuation day. When a
                    market is particularly volatile, funds dealing on a historic
                    basis would need to defer trading and re-calculate the

                    exceed 10% of the total number of units / shares in issue,
                    orders in excess of the 10% may be deferred to the next
                    dealing day. In such cases, a fund may deal with the
                    investors’ redemption orders on an equitable basis up to the
                    10% limit, with the outstanding requests carried forward to

                <span
                  ><p>
                    The concept of “Class B” funds is derived from the US to
                    distinguish funds of different fee structures (commonly
                    referred to as the “load”).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Under this concept, traditional funds are called “Class A”
                    funds, which charge investors a few percentages of
                    subscription fee upon their purchase, i.e. they are
                    front-end load funds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the other hand, “Class B” funds are back-end load
                    investments which require no upfront subscription fee. Thus,
                    investors buying a Class B fund have 100% of their capital
                    invested in the fund. However, they are charged a fee upon
                    their redemption of that fund.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The redemption fee payable by Class B fund holders decline
                    with the time they hold the funds. For instance, the
                    redemption fee may start, say, from 4% in the 1st year and
                    then down to 1% in the 4th year with an annual decrement of
                    1%. So, usually, the longer investors hold the Class B fund,
                    the lower the redemption fee they have to bear. Investors
                    may not even have to pay any load if they redeem their
                    holdings after having been in the fund for over 4 years.

                    Dollar cost averaging means buying units in a fund
                    periodically with a fixed sum, regardless of the condition
                    of the markets of the fund’s underlying investments. For
                    instance, you join a monthly savings plan offered by an
                    intermediary and contribute a fixed amount monthly to buy
                    units of a designated fund.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With this strategy, you may buy low or high. When the unit
                    price rises, fewer units are purchased for the given amount
                    of money. Conversely, more units are purchased for the fixed
                    amount when the unit price drops. Normally, dividends
                    distributed by the fund are reinvested to become part of
                    your dollar cost averaging portfolio.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Advocates of this approach of fund investing believe that
                    the impacts of the market’s up-and-down swings on investors
                    are reduced. Moreover, in this way, investors do not have to
                    time the market to make their subscriptions.

                    Futures contracts are derivative instruments. A stock
                    futures contract represents a commitment to buy or sell a
                    predefined amount of the underlying stock at a predetermined
                    price on a specified future date.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When you buy a stock&nbsp;futures contract, you are holding
                    a long position and have to buy the underlying stock on the
                    final settlement date. However, you can choose to hold a
                    short position by selling a stock futures contract – this
                    means that you have to sell the underlying stock according
                    to the contract terms.

                    Despite the diversity in futures contracts, they do share
                    some common features. Also certain terms are frequently used
                    in many exchange-traded futures contracts:
                  </p>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Underlying asset</strong>: Assets underlying
                      futures contracts can be quite varied. They include
                      stocks, indices, currencies, interest rates, commodities,
                      such as oil, beans and gold. HKEx futures contracts are
                      financial futures mainly based on interest rates, gold,
                      stocks and stock indices such as the HSI, H-shares Index.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Contracted price</strong>: The price at which a
                      futures contract is registered by the clearing house, i.e.
                      the traded price.

                    <li>
                      <strong>Contract multiplier</strong>: The weight that is
                      multiplied by the contracted price when calculating the
                      contracted value. With HSI and H-Shares Index futures, the
                      contract multiplier is $50 per index point, whereas in a
                      mini-HSI futures contract, it is $10 per index point. For
                      HKEx stock futures contracts, this is one board lot of the
                      underlying stock.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Last trading day</strong>: The last day when a
                      futures contract can be traded on an exchange.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Final settlement day</strong>: The day when the
                      buyer and the seller must settle the futures contract.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Final settlement price</strong>: The fixed price
                      determined by the clearing house and used to calculate the
                      futures contract’s final settlement value. Multiplying the
                      final settlement price by the contract multiplier gives
                      the final settlement value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Settlement method</strong>: A futures contract can
                      be settled by cash or by physical delivery of the
                      underlying asset. All futures contracts traded on the HKEx
                      (except for Three-year Exchange Fund Note futures) are
                      settled in cash.

                    Generally, there are three main reasons for trading futures:
                    directional trading, hedging and arbitrage.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Directional trading</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    If you expect the stock market to rally, you can opt for
                    directional trading by buying a stock index futures
                    contract. You make a profit if the final settlement price is
                    higher than the contracted price when you bought the futures
                    contract. On any day on or before the last trading day, if
                    the going price of the index futures is more than the
                    contracted price, you can realise your profit by selling the
                    same futures contract to offset your original long position.
                    On the other hand, if you think the market will fall, you
                    can sell a stock index futures contract.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Hedging</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    Hedging strategies are commonly used to offset any negative
                    effects on an investor’s portfolio return. If you want to
                    mitigate your loss in a falling market, then you can use a
                    short hedge by shorting a stock futures contract. Or you can
                    apply a long hedge to lock in the buying price for the
                    underlying stock on a future date by buying a stock futures
                    contract. If the stock price rises, you will be able to buy
                    the stock for less than the going market price.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you are trading in futures, you must remember to pick
                    futures contracts in which the underlying assets correspond
                    to your holdings. For example, HSI futures are not the ideal
                    tool to hedge red chipswhich are not HSI constituent stocks.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Arbitrage</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    Arbitrage allows you to earn profits by capitalising on
                    unusual price discrepancies between the futures market and
                    the underlying cash market. You can do this by executing
                    opposite trades simultaneously in the two markets.

                    Whether you buy or sell a futures contract, you have to
                    deposit an initial margin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the end of each trading day, your position is “marked to
                    market”, or valued according to the contract’s market value
                    at the end of the day. If the contract price moves against
                    your view so the initial margin deposit falls below the
                    maintenance margin level, your brokerage will normally issue
                    amargin call. This means you will have to deposit additional
                    money to restore the initial margin level. If you don’t do
                    this, your brokerage may liquidate your position at market.
                    You will have to bear any loss arising from the forced
                    liquidation.

                    Transaction costs vary for futures traded on different
                    exchanges. For futures trading on the HKEx, transaction
                    costs include a brokerage commission (usually at a flat
                    rate, chargeable each time a futures contract is bought and
                    sold), an exchange fee, SFC levy ($1 per contract per side)
                    and investor compensation levy ($0.50 per contract per
                    side).

                    Suppose you have bought a commodity futures contract for
                    directional trading and the price of the underlying
                    commodity goes against your view, you can close your
                    position to limit your loss. To close, you reverse an
                    original position by taking an equal but opposite trade on
                    the “same” contract. Normally by default, your brokerage
                    should, on your behalf, give instructions to the exchange or
                    the clearing house to net off your position. As a result,
                    you will not have any outstanding position on the futures
                    contracts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But when there are difficulties in closing out a position,
                    for example if there is “limit up” or “limit down” in a
                    particular delivery month or if a market is closed for
                    holiday, you may “lock” a position to offset the price risk
                    associated with an open position.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An effective lock normally involves the taking of an equal
                    but opposite trade on a “similar” contract (e.g. a contract
                    with a different expiry date, or one traded on another
                    exchange but linked to the same underlying assets) to your
                    original position. If you hold a long position in a red bean
                    contract for delivery in December 2002, to lock the position
                    you may short a red bean contract for delivery in March
                    2003. This is different from “closing” a position, as you
                    will hold a “long” and a “short” position in different
                    futures contracts simultaneously. Depending on the policy of
                    the brokerage you are using, you may have to put up margin
                    deposits for each “long” and “short” position you maintain,
                    although you may save on margin on subsequent contracts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you want to close out a position and are prepared to take
                    the loss, if any, and if you are able to enter into an equal
                    but opposite trade in the same contract, you should consider
                    doing it. If you attempt to “lock” the position using the
                    same contract and keep the long and short positions in the
                    same futures contract simultaneously, the two open positions
                    would need to be closed out subsequently and additional
                    commission may be incurred.

                    Trading of futures contracts is available during the regular
                    trading sessions: 9:15am to 12:00 noon and 1:00pm to 4:15pm

                    Starting from 8 April 2013, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing
                    Limited (HKEx) will introduce an extended trading session
                    for futures trading, known as After-Hours Futures Trading
                    (AHFT), from 5:00pm to 11:00pm. Initially, only Hang Seng
                    Index futures and Hang Seng H-shares Index futures will be
                    traded during AHFT session.

                      All the trades executed during the after-hours session
                      will be registered as AHFT trades. They will be cleared
                      and settled on the following trading day by the clearing
                      house, together with trades executed during the regular
                      trading sessions of that day. Investors should check with
                      their brokers the arrangements for trading, settlement and
                      the issuance of contract notes and statements of account.

                      A 5% price limit up/down mechanism is introduced during
                      the AHFT session. Sell orders with a price below 95% of
                      the last traded price for the spot month contract in the
                      regular trading sessions and buy orders with a price above
                      105% will not be allowed. The upper and lower price limit
                      will apply to all contract months. Trading will be allowed
                      only within the price limit range during AHFT session.
                      Although there will not be suspension of trading,
                      investors will not be allowed to trade at prices outside
                      the price limit.<br />

                    To ensure sufficient trading liquidity during AHFT, HKEx has
                    appointed some liquidity providers to provide quotes at the
                    initial stage of the implementation of AHFT. That means
                    abnormal price deviations can be adjusted by market forces.

                    Setting the price limit of +/-5% may also be helpful in

                    An&nbsp;option&nbsp;is a contract that involves two parties,
                    a buyer and a seller. An option’s buyer has the right, but
                    not the obligation, to buy according to a “call” option
                    from, or sell according to a “put” option to the seller the
                    specified underlying asset. Option contracts are for an
                    agreed quantity of an underlying asset, price, and future
                    period. If the buyer (or “holder”) exercises his right, the
                    option’s seller (“writer”) has to settle according to the
                    contract’s specifications. An option holder is described as
                    having a long position, while an option writer has a short
                    position.

                      currencies, debt instruments, and so on. In Hong Kong,

                      stocks and market indices.

                      <strong>Exercise style</strong>: There are two types of

                      during any trading day on or before the expiry date.
                      European-style options, on the other hand, can only be
                      exercised on the expiry day.

                      <strong>Settlement method</strong>: This is the
                      predetermined method in which the writer settles an
                      option, and depends on what’s stated in the contract. An
                      option can be settled either by physical delivery of the
                      underlying asset or in cash.

                      loss because of the premium paid for it, so probably won’t
                      be exercised.

                      <strong>Out-of-the-money</strong>: When the underlying
                      asset’s price is lower than the exercise price of a call
                      option or higher than that of a put option, the option
                      will not be exercised given the holder will lose money on

                    When you buy an option, you pay a premium. If you sell an
                    option, you receive the premium, but at the same time you
                    have to deposit an initial margin in your trading account to
                    support your short position.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If the underlying asset’s price falls when you thought it
                    would rise (or vice versa), you will suffer an unrealised
                    loss in your option position. If this takes your margin
                    deposit below the maintenance margin level, your broker will
                    issue a margin call, asking you to deposit cash so the
                    margin rises to its initial level. If you don’t or can’t do
                    this, your broker may close your position without letting
                    you know in advance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Normally, the exchange on which the option is traded sets
                    initial and maintenance margin levels. However, your broker
                    may set higher margin levels. You must clarify margin levels
                    with your broker before you start trading.<br />
                    In Hong Kong, exchange-traded options operate under a
                    market-making system so as to provide market liquidity.
                    Responsible exchange participants input quotes to the

                    Longing and shorting options are two different strategies.
                    An option holder, who takes the long position, pays a
                    premium to the option’s writer. If performance of the
                    underlying asset goes against the holder, his maximum loss
                    will be limited to the premium paid.

                    An option writer, who takes the short position, receives a
                    premium from the holder. In exchange, he takes up the
                    obligation to settle the contract as specified when the
                    holder exercises the option. If the market goes against the
                    option writer, he may suffer a substantial loss exceeding
                    the premium received.

                    (e.g. a stock) at a pre-set price on or before a specified

                    Compared with stocks, warrants have more attributes which
                    include:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Issuer</strong>: A warrant can be issued by a
                      listed company (i.e. subscription warrant) or a third
                      party such as a financial institution (i.e. derivative
                      warrant).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Underlying asset</strong>: It can be a single
                      stock, a basket of stocks, an index, a currency, a
                      commodity, a futures contract (e.g. oil futures) etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Types of embedded rights</strong>: Don’t mix up a
                      call warrant with a put warrant. A call warrant gives you
                      the right to buy whereas a put warrant gives you the right
                      to sell the underlying asset.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Exercise price</strong>: The price at which you
                      buy or sell the underlying asset in exercising a warrant.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Conversion ratio</strong>: This refers to the
                      number of units of the underlying asset exchanged when
                      exercising a unit of a warrant. Normally, in Hong Kong a
                      derivative warrant on shares has the ratio of 1 (i.e.one
                      warrant for one share) or 10 (i.e.10 warrants for one
                      share).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Expiry date</strong>: The date on which a warrant
                      will expire and become worthless if the warrant is not
                      exercised.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Exercise style</strong>: With an American warrant,
                      you can exercise to buy/sell the underlying asset on or
                      before the expiry date. Whereas a European warrant allows
                      exercise on the expiry date only.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Settlement</strong>: A warrant can be settled by
                      cash or physical delivery upon exercise.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Some warrants have more sophisticated features and are
                    generally referred to as exotic warrants.

                    Assuming other factors remain constant, if the amount of the

                    ex-dividend date of stock B, because the dividend element

                    declared a dividend lower than expected, investors who
                    bought call warrant A at a cheaper price would gain as the

                    On the other hand, if stock B declared a larger dividend
                    than expected, the price of warrant A would be expected to
                    drop further, assuming other factors remain unchanged.
                    Accordingly, investors who bought warrant A would lose.

                    A bond is a debt instrument issued for a predetermined
                    period of time with the purpose of raising capital by
                    borrowing. A bond generally involves a promise to repay
                    the&nbsp;principal&nbsp;and interest on specified dates.
                    This kind of debt instrument may also be called as bills or
                    notes and these names are used interchangeably in the

                      <strong>Issuer</strong>: This is the party that borrows
                      the money. Bonds are commonly classified by the nature of
                      their issuer, for example, corporate bonds (issued by
                      companies or their subsidiaries), government bonds (such
                      as Exchange Fund Notes issued by the Hong Kong Monetary
                      Authority), and bonds issued by supranational

                      <strong>Principal</strong>: This is also called the par
                      value or face value. It is the amount repaid to the
                      bondholder when the bond matures.

                    <li>
                      <strong>Coupon rate</strong>: This is the rate at which
                      the issuer pays interest on the principal to the
                      bondholder each year. Interest payments are normally made
                      at regular intervals, e.g. annually, semi-annually,
                      quarterly. The coupon rate can be fixed, where it does not
                      change over the term of the bond. It can be floating,
                      where it is reset periodically according to a
                      predetermined benchmark, such as HIBORplus a spread. The
                      coupon rate can even be zero. A zero-coupon bond is
                      usually sold at a price below its principal. The
                      bondholder’s return is then the difference between the
                      purchase price and the principal repaid on maturity.

                      <strong>Term</strong>: This is the life of the bond, i.e.
                      the period (usually a number of years) over which the
                      issuer has promised to meet its obligations under the
                      bond. Some bonds can be “perpetual” in the sense that they

                    As their names imply, renminbi bonds are settled in
                    renminbi. This means that their denomination (principal),
                    coupon (interest) and price are denominated in renminbi.
                    Read the offering document of a renminbi bond carefully to
                    understand the background and credit rating of the bond
                    issuer, the terms and conditions of the bond such as its
                    denomination, duration, coupon rate and frequency of
                    interest payment, as well as the risk factors of the bond,
                    etc.

                    Under the current regulations, only Hong Kong SAR residents
                    with Hong Kong SAR identity cards may open personal renminbi
                    accounts in Hong Kong. Currently, a maximum exchange limit
                    of RMB20,000 per banknote exchange transaction by
                    individuals is imposed. Similarly, the same daily limit of
                    RMB20,000 per person applies to conversion via renminbi
                    accounts. So, when you subscribe for renminbi bonds worth
                    more than RMB20,000, you need to convert your capital into
                    renminbi through several exchanges.<br />
                    For corporate entities, there are no general legal
                    restrictions on the opening a renminbi account with a
                    renminbi participant bank, exchange renminbi with other
                    currencies and transfers of renminbi between different
                    accounts in Hong Kong. Your bank will need to comply with
                    the usual banking practices and requirements in Hong Kong in
                    handling these transactions for you.

                    Generally speaking, retail renminbi bonds are offered to the
                    public through distributing banks. The bond issuer will not
                    issue any application form. You will be required to complete
                    and sign on an order form prepared by a distributing bank
                    with which you open a renminbi account for settling your
                    investment in a renminbi bond. You will also need to make a
                    number of acknowledgements and confirmations, for instance,
                    to confirm that you have read and understood the description
                    of the terms of a bond set out in the offering document and

                    Renminbi bonds can be either listed or unlisted. This will
                    be disclosed in the relevant offering document. Listed
                    renminbi bonds are traded on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong
                    (SEHK) whereas unlisted renminbi bonds are traded

                    In general, a non-Mainland (including Hong Kong) investor
                    who holds a local currency other than renminbi will be
                    exposed to currency risk if he/she invests in a renminbi
                    product. This is because renminbi is a restricted currency
                    and subject to exchange controls, you may have to convert
                    the local currency into renminbi when you invest in a
                    renminbi product. When you redeem / sell your investment,
                    you may also need to convert the renminbi received upon
                    redemption / sale of your investment product into the local
                    currency (even if redemptions / sale proceeds are paid in
                    renminbi). During these processes, you will incur currency
                    conversion costs and you will also be exposed to currency
                    risk. In other words, even if the price of the renminbi
                    product remains the same when you purchase it and when you
                    redeem / sell it, you will still incur a loss when you
                    convert the redemption / sale proceeds into local currency
                    if renminbi has depreciated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Like any currency, the exchange rate of renminbi may rise or
                    fall. Further, renminbi is subject to conversion
                    restrictions and foreign exchange control mechanism.

                      <strong>Investment / market risk</strong>: Like any
                      investments, renminbi products are subject to investment
                      risk and may not be principal protected i.e. the assets
                      that the products invest in or referenced to may fall as
                      well as rise, resulting in gains or losses to the product.
                      This means that you may suffer a loss even if renminbi
                      appreciates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Liquidity risk</strong>: Renminbi products are
                      also subject to liquidity risk as renminbi products are a
                      new type of product and there may not be regular trading
                      or an active secondary market. Therefore you may not be
                      able to sell your investment in the product on a timely
                      basis, or you may have to sell the product at a deep
                      discount to its value.

                    <li>
                      <strong>Issuer / counterparty risk</strong>: Renminbi
                      products are subject to the credit and insolvency risks of
                      their issuers. You should consider carefully the
                      creditworthiness of the issuers before investing.
                      Furthermore, as a renminbi product may invest in
                      derivative instruments, counterparty risk may also arise
                      as the default by the derivative issuers may adversely
                      affect the performance of the renminbi products and result
                      in substantial losses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Currency risk</strong>: As explained in Question 2
                      above, an investor is also subject to the risk of renminbi
                      depreciation if he/she intends to convert any
                      renminbi-denominated redemption / sale proceeds into
                      another currency.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Depending on the nature of the renminbi product and its
                    investment objective, there may be other risk factors
                    specific to the product which you should consider. Before
                    making an investment decision, always read the risk factors
                    as set out in the offering documents and seek professional
                    advice where necessary.

                    stock market or a group of stock markets in a region or
                    elsewhere in the world. It can also be on bonds or

                    An ETF gives investors an indirect access to a certain
                    market. By investing in an ETF, investors can receive a
                    return that replicates (although not 100% in most cases) the
                    performance of the index without actually owning the
                    constituents that comprise the index. In some cases, an ETF
                    tracks an index of a market that has restricted access (such
                    as, the China A-share market and the Indian market), thus
                    giving investors indirect access to a market that is not
                    accessible by foreign investors not domiciled in that
                    jurisdiction.

                    are also tradable on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK).

                    <strong>Index tracking</strong> – To achieve the index
                    tracking objective, a fund manager may adopt one or more of
                    the following strategies:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      full replication by investing in a portfolio of securities
                      that replicates the composition of the underlying index;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      representative sampling by investing in a portfolio of
                      securities featuring a high correlation with the
                      underlying index, but is not exactly the same as those in
                      the index; or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      synthetic replication through the use of financial
                      derivative instruments to replicate the index performance.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Synthetic replication is sometimes used by an ETF to raise
                    efficiency and reduce cost. Where an ETF tracks a market (or
                    an index in a market) that has restricted access, it has no
                    other choice but to adopt synthetic replication through the
                    use of financial derivative instruments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Trading price vs. Net Asset Value (NAV)</strong> –
                    Each ETF has an NAV that is calculated with reference to the
                    market value of the investments held by it. However, the
                    trading price of an ETF on the SEHK, like that of a stock,
                    is also determined by the supply and demand of the market.
                    The trading price of an ETF may not therefore be equal to
                    its NAV, and this disparity may give rise to arbitraging
                    opportunities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Dividend entitlement</strong> – An ETF may or may
                    not distribute dividends, depending on its dividend policy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Fees and charges</strong> – An ETF incurs certain
                    fees and expenses such as management fees charged by the ETF
                    manager and other administrative costs. These fees and
                    expenses will be deducted from the ETF’s assets and the NAV
                    will be reduced accordingly. Like stocks, trading ETFs on
                    the SEHK incurs transaction costs such as stamp duty,
                    transaction levy and brokerage commission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Regulated fund</strong> – Like other authorized
                    funds, an ETF has to comply with the relevant regulatory
                    requirements imposed by the SFC. However, you should note
                    that SFC authorization does not imply recommendation of the
                    product.
