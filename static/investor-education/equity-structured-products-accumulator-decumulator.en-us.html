        ><strong>What is Accumulator (Decumulator)?</strong></span
      >
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      It is a series of forward contract for clients to buy (sell*) the
      reference share at a pre-determined price in each Exchange Business Day
      during the life of contract.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      Pre-determined purchase (selling*) price (i.e. strike price) is usually at
      discount (premium*) to the initial fixing price for accumulator
      (decumulator*).
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      <strong>Knock Out feature</strong>&nbsp;(at day close) which may lead to
      termination of contract prior to maturity date.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      <strong>Leverage / Gearing feature</strong>&nbsp;is that if closing price
      of reference share is below (above*) the strike price, client has to buy
      (sell under decumulator*) more number of shares than in normal days which
      equals to the number of times of leverage.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      <strong>Guaranteed number of shares feature</strong>&nbsp;is that if the
      Knock Out event triggers within the guaranteed period, guaranteed number
      of shares (number of shares bought / sold* in normal days x no of days in
      the guaranteed period) will be delivered to client at strike price
      (settlement at Knock Out Date + 1 settlement cycle)
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      Stamp Duty and Levy paid by client if there is share settlement.
    </p>

      <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Features</strong></span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        Purchase (sold*) the reference share at a discount (premium*) price
        compared to the Initial Spot Fixing

    </ul>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Risks</strong></span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <strong>Liquidity Risk</strong>&nbsp;– no active secondary market, high
        exit costs and losses
      </li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <strong>Investment Risk</strong>&nbsp;– investors have to take up
        (sell*) the agreed amount of the underlying asset at the strike price
        even when the market price falls below the strike price resulting in
        potential significant loss
      </li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <strong>Credit Risk</strong>&nbsp;– client takes the credit risk of the
        issuer
      </li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <strong>Leverage Risk</strong>&nbsp;(if applies) – the potential loss
        could be magnified
      </li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <strong>Knock Out Risk</strong>&nbsp;– investors potential profit is
        capped by such feature which means the risk of terminating the contract
        at a date earlier than maturity date
      </li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <strong>Mark-to-Market Risk</strong>&nbsp;– for margin based investors,
        they need to be prepared for paying interest cost for margin / credit
        facility and meeting margin calls, the margin calls may be given at
        short notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;When investors fail to meet margin calls, the
        contracts may be closed out without the investors’ consent and the
        investors have to bear the consequential losses and
        costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a risk of the accumulator / decumulator
        of which the underlying shares moving in an unfavorable direction
        resulting in loss.
      </li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <strong>Settlement Risk</strong>&nbsp;– the risk that the counterparty
        failed to deliver as per agreement.
      </li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        Before the settlement of shares, investor cannot enjoy the shareholder
        right and benefit by holding an accumulator.

    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      For accumulator, the worst case is when the reference share price falls to
      zero throughout&nbsp;<strong>the entire life of tenor</strong
      >.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, investor purchases the maximum number of
      shares until the end of accumulator tenor.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the investor
      realizes his profit / loss by selling the number of shares in the market
      where the stock price falls to zero, the maximum loss = (strike price – 0)
      x maximum number of shares per day x number of days.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      For decumulator, the worst case is when the reference share rises above
      the strike price throughout&nbsp;<strong>the entire life of tenor</strong
      >.&nbsp;&nbsp;The downside risk is theoretically unlimited.

      Investing in Equity Accumulator / Decumulator involves market risk. There
      are many factors that affect the market value of this product. Changes in
      the price or value of the underlying stock can be unpredictable, sudden
      and large. Such changes may result in the price of the underlying moving
      adversely to Investor’s interests and negatively impacting on the return
      on this product. For equity accumulator, Investor may suffer substantial
      loss as he is bound by this product to buy periodically the agreed amount
      of the underlying asset when the market price falls below the Strike
      Price.&nbsp;&nbsp;For equity decumulator, Investor may suffer substantial

      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        Investment involves risk. The price of a Derivative Product may
        fluctuate, sometimes dramatically; it may move up or down and may even
        become valueless. It is likely that loss may be incurred rather than
        profit made as a result of buying and/or selling a particular Derivative
        Product. Past performance figures are not indicative of future
        performance. The Investor should carefully read the term sheets (for
        Derivative Products) and other relevant documents for details before
        making any investment decisions, and thereafter, should regularly check
        for update of information relating to the Derivative Products.
      </li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        Derivative Products are complex and involve different types of risks.
        The risk of loss resulting from investments in such Derivative Products
        can be substantial with a total loss of capital value. The Investor
        should: (a) study and understand the structure of the Derivative
        Products before placing any orders; and (b) have prior experience with
        investment in the Derivative Products and fully understand the
        associated risks before making a decision to invest in such products and
        ensure that the products are suitable in light of his financial position
        and investment objectives.

    </p>
    <p>
      1.&nbsp; &nbsp; Derivative Products often involve a high degree of
      gearing, so that a relatively small movement in the price of
      the&nbsp;underly-<br />
      ing securities results in&nbsp;a disproportionately large movement in the
      price. The values of Derivative Products are not&nbsp;fixed,<br />
      but fluctuate with the market, which may be influenced by many factors,
      including changes in the&nbsp;economic&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;political<br />
      environment. The prices of Derivative Products can therefore be volatile.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.&nbsp; &nbsp; a)&nbsp; Investors &nbsp;should&nbsp; not&nbsp; buy
      &nbsp;a Derivative&nbsp; Product unless it is&nbsp; prepared to sustain a
      total loss of the &nbsp;investment plus any commission or other
      transaction charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      b)&nbsp; While Derivative Products are unexercised and if their underlying
      securities are suspended from trading on the relevant stock exchanges,
      they may be suspended from trading for a similar period of time as their
      underlying securities.
    </p>
    <p>
      c)&nbsp; Depending on the structure of a particular Derivative Product, an
      investor may be obligated to accept delivery or make delivery (as the case
      may be) of the underlying securities if the conversion price is triggered
      or pursuant to the terms and conditions of the relevant agreement,
      contract or confirmation of the subject Transaction. Depending on the
      market conditions, an investor may be obligated to accept delivery of the
      underlying securities at a price which is above the market price such
      securities or to make delivery of the underlying securities at a price
      which is below the market price of such securities and losses may occur
      resulting from such actions which can be substantial. The loss resulting
      from investing in such Derivative Products can be over and above the
      initial amounts invested to a substantial extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      d)&nbsp; If there is an extraordinary event or an adjustment event such a
      stock split, issue of bonus shares or other unexpected event that changes
      the number, value or weighting of issued shares of the underlying stock,
      the counter-party/calculation agent may adjust the contract terms, at its
      sole discretion, to reflect the new market conditions. This may include
      unwinding the contract. The investor should seek independent advice from
      professional parties in the event of such extraordinary events or
      adjustments.
    </p>
    <p>
      e)&nbsp; Early termination prior to maturity is possible subject to the
      terms and conditions governing the Derivative Product and prevailing
      market terms and conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      f)&nbsp; The value of the Derivative Products may be reduced due to any
      downgrades by rating agencies such as Moody’s Investors Inc. or Standard
      &amp; Poor’s Rating Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      g)&nbsp; Structured products are formed by combining two or more financial
      instruments and may include one or more Derivative Products. Structured
      products may carry a high degree of risk and may not be suitable for many
      members of the public, as the risks associated with the financial
      instruments or Derivative Products may be interconnected. As such, the
      extent of loss due to market movements can be substantial. Prior to
      engaging in structured product Transactions, the Investor should
      understand the inherent risks involved. In particular, the various risks
      associated with each financial instrument or Derivative Product should be
      evaluated separately as well as taking the structured product as a whole.
      Each structured product has its own risk profile and given the unlimited
      number of possible combinations, it is not possible to detail in this RDS
      all the risks which may arise in any particular case. The Investor should
      note that with structured products, buyers can only assert their rights
      against the issuer. Hence, particular attention needs to be paid to issuer
      risk. The Investor should therefore be aware that a total loss of his
      investment is possible if the issuer should default.
    </p>
    <p>
      h)&nbsp; The prices of the underlying securities of Derivative Products
      fluctuate, sometimes dramatically. The price of a security may move up or
      down, and may become valueless. Accordingly, it is as likely that loss
      will be incurred rather than profit made as a result of buying or selling
      Derivative Products. In particular, for some Derivative Products such as
      accumulators, depending on market conditions, an investor may be obligated
      to accept delivery of the underlying securities at a price which is above
      the market price of such securities and loss may occur resulting from such
      action which can be substantial. Similarly, for some Derivative Products
      such as decumulators, an investor may be obligated to make delivery of the
      underlying securities at a price which is below the market price of such
      securities and loss may occur resulting from such action which can be
      substantial. The loss resulting from investing in such Derivative Products
      can be over and above the initial amounts invested to a substantial
      extent.
