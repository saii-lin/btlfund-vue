        ><strong>What is Bond?</strong></span
      >
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      Bond is a debt security in which the authorized issuer owes the holders a
      debt and is obliged to repay the principal and the interest (the coupon)
      at a later date, termed maturity.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, a&nbsp;bond
      is simply a loan but in the form of a security.

        ><strong>Features of Bond</strong></span
      >
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Issuer</strong></p>
    <p>
      The issuer is the borrower.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be government, financial
      institution or corporate.&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, all legal entities can
      issue bonds to finance their operation activities subject to the approval
      of the respective regulations of their jurisdictions.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Primary &amp; Secondary Market</strong></p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      Primary market refers to the issuance of&nbsp;new&nbsp;debt
      instrument.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary market refers to the trading
      of&nbsp;bonds / fixed income products OTC.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Nominal / Principal / Face Amount</strong></p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      It is the&nbsp;stated value of an issued security.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also
      the&nbsp;amount over which the issuer pays interest and which has to be
      repaid at the&nbsp;maturity.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Issue Price</strong></p>
    <p>The price at which investors buy the bonds&nbsp;in primary market.</p>
    <p><strong>Maturity Date</strong></p>
    <p>The date&nbsp;on which the principal amount becomes due and payable.</p>
    <p><strong>Coupon</strong></p>
    <p>
      The interest rate stated on a bond when it is issued.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      coupon can be fixed or float.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Yield</strong></p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;"><u>Yield to Maturity</u></p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      The percentage rate of return paid if the security is held to its maturity
      date.&nbsp;&nbsp;The calculation is based on the coupon rate, length of
      time to maturity, and market price.&nbsp;&nbsp;It assumes that coupon
      interest paid over the life of the security is reinvested at the same
      rate.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        When a bond’s&nbsp;coupon rate&nbsp;is&nbsp;lower&nbsp;than its YTM,
        then the bond is selling at a discount.
      </li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        When a bond’s&nbsp;coupon rate&nbsp;is&nbsp;higher&nbsp;than its YTM,
        then the bond is selling at a premium.
      </li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        When a bond’s&nbsp;coupon rate&nbsp;is equal to its YTM, then the bond
        is selling at par.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;"><u>Current Yield</u></p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      The annual rate of return based on the price.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is calculated
      as&nbsp; (coupon rate * par amount / price) / 100
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Credit Rating</strong></p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      There are two major credit rating agencies to evaluate the
      creditworthiness of bonds, namely Moody’s and Standard &amp; Poor’s.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      A&nbsp;bond&nbsp;is&nbsp;regarded as&nbsp;investment grade&nbsp;if its
      credit rating is BBB- or higher by&nbsp;Standard &amp; Poor’s&nbsp;or Baa3
      or higher by&nbsp;Moody’s.&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-investment grade
      bonds&nbsp;refer to bonds with&nbsp;BB+&nbsp;or&nbsp;below&nbsp;Standard
      &amp; Poor’s credit rating or&nbsp;Ba1 or below&nbsp;Moody’s&nbsp;credit
      rating.&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher the credit rating of a bond, the more likely
      the issuer can meet its debt obligation.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      In general, the lower the rating, the higher the yield&nbsp;that investors
      can get so as to&nbsp;compensate for higher risk&nbsp;they need to bear.

        ><strong>Scenario Analysis</strong></span
      >
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      <strong>Scenario 1</strong><strong>&nbsp;(Hold to maturity)</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      For&nbsp;investor&nbsp;who owns&nbsp;a bond, collects the coupon and holds
      it to maturity, market volatility is irrelevant; principal and interest
      are received according to a pre-determined
      schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore,&nbsp;investor&nbsp;could get the principal
      amount and the interest payments if he/she holds it until maturity
      and&nbsp;assuming&nbsp;the Issuer does not have any default event.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      <strong>Scenario 2 (Sell before maturity)</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      Investor&nbsp;who sells bonds before maturity is exposed to many
      risks,&nbsp;among others&nbsp;changes in interest rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;When
      interest rates increase, the&nbsp;price&nbsp;of
      bonds&nbsp;may&nbsp;fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, when interest
      rates&nbsp;fall, the&nbsp;price&nbsp;of
      bonds&nbsp;may&nbsp;rise.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the&nbsp;investor&nbsp;may
      enjoy a capital gain or suffer capital loss when he/she sells the bond
      before maturity.

        ><strong>General Key Risks of Fixed Income Products</strong></span
      >
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        Fixed income products (even for plain-vanilla bonds) are not risk free
        products suitable for all investors.&nbsp;The price of fixed income
        products can and does fluctuate, sometimes dramatically and may become
        valueless.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is as likely that losses will be incurred
        rather than profit made as a result of buying and selling of fixed
        income products.&nbsp;&nbsp;Holders of fixed income products, including
        plain-vanilla bonds, are subject to various risks, including but not
        limited to:
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;"><u>Credit Risk</u></p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      The value of a fixed income product is determined by the quality of the
      credit and the likelihood of default.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the credit risk of a
      fixed income product increases, any changes to that perceived credit risk
      tend to have an increased impact on the price of the
      product.&nbsp;&nbsp;The credit risk of high yield bonds (which are
      generally below investment grade or are unrated) is significant, and
      therefore, a change in the credit quality of an issuer of high yield bonds
      will be apt to have a significant impact on the bonds.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      holder of fixed income products bears the credit risk of the issuer and/or
      guarantor (if applicable) and credit ratings assigned by credit rating
      agencies do not guarantee creditworthiness of the issuer and/or guarantor
      (if applicable).&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors shall beware that credit rating of
      guarantor should not be confused with that of the issuer or the bond /
      debenture.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;"><u>Liquidity Risk</u></p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      Some fixed income products may not have active secondary markets and it
      would be difficult or impossible for investors to sell them before
      maturity or they may be forced to sell at a significant discount to market
      value.&nbsp;&nbsp;Liquidity risk is greater for thinly traded securities
      such as lower-rated products, products that were part of a small issue,
      products that have recently had their credit rating downgraded or products
      sold by an infrequent issuer.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;"><u>Interest Rate Risk</u></p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      Fixed income products are more susceptible to fluctuations in interest
      rates and generally prices of fixed income products will fall when
      interest rates rise.&nbsp;&nbsp;If interest rates go up, the price of the
      debt security will, other factors being equal, go down, thereby increasing
      the current yield (the annual interest payment divided by the price of the
      debt security) and bringing it into line with the higher coupon rates
      offered by new debt issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;If interest rates go down, the
      price of the debt security will increase, thereby reducing the current
      yield and bringing it into line with the lower coupon rates offered by new
      debt issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of the debt security may be higher or
      lower than the original investment if it is sold before maturity.
    </p>
    <ol start="2">
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        Not all fixed income products provide for repayment of 100% of their
        face values.&nbsp;Returns on a fixed income product depends on the terms
        of issue and reference should be made to the corresponding prospectus or
        term sheet for details, and there may be circumstances that the money
        and/or value of the securities investors receive at maturity is
        substantially less than the value of their original
        investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any fractional share(s) or other
        securities or underlying assets deliverables on maturity, it/they may
        not be physically delivered.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="3">
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        In situations where any fixed income product is a product combining note
        with financial or other derivatives, such as options, its return may be
        linked to the performance of other financial instruments, such as
        underlying stocks, commodities, currencies, companies, and
        indices.&nbsp;Unless such product is listed on Exchange or other
        regulated stock exchanges, investors will only be able to sell such
        product on the over-the-counter market, if at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;The prices
        of fixed income products in secondary markets are affected by a wide
        range of factors, including without limitation, the performance of the
        underlying stocks, commodities, currencies, companies, indices, the
        market view of the credit quality of the relevant company, and interest
        rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors must be aware that secondary markets do not
        always exist and even where a secondary market exists, it may not be
        liquid.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors must accept any associated liquidity risk.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="4">
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        Transactions in options carry a high degree of risk (including products
        that have options embedded in them).&nbsp;Purchasers and sellers of
        options should familiarize themselves with the type of option (i.e. put
        or call) which they contemplate trading and the associated risks.

      In addition to the generic risks set out above, investments in high-yield
      bonds are subject to risks including:
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      <strong>(a)&nbsp; &nbsp; Higher Credit Risk –<em>&nbsp;</em></strong
      >Since they are typically rated below investment grade or are unrated and

        <u>Bonds with Other Special Features</u>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      Some bonds may contain special features and risks that warrant attention
      of investors, they include:
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      <strong>(a)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong
      ><strong>Subordinated –<em>&nbsp;</em></strong
      >Certain bonds are subordinated, and investors would only have
      subordinated ranking, in case of liquidation of the issuer, which means
      investors can only get back the principal after other senior creditors are
      paid.&nbsp;&nbsp;Holders of subordinated debentures will bear higher risks
      than holders of senior debentures of the issuer due to a lower priority of
      claim in the event of the issuer’s liquidation.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      <strong>(b)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong
      ><strong>Perpetual –</strong>&nbsp;Certain bonds are perpetual in nature
      and interest pay-out depends on the viability of the issuer in the very
      long term.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors should beware that such bonds do not have
      a maturity date, and the coupon payments may be deferred or even suspended
      subject to the terms and conditions of the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
      investors shall also pay attention to the following risks that are often
      applicable to Perpetual bonds:
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;"><u>Reinvestment Risks</u></p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      Reinvestment risk is related to interest rate risk, but has the opposite
      effect on a bond’s performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;It refers to the risk that the
      rate at which coupon and principal cash flows from a bond are reinvested
      will be lower than the expected rate in effect when the bond was
      purchased.&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk increases for bonds with longer maturities
      and higher coupon payments, and decreases for bonds with shorter
      maturities and lower coupon rates.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;"><u>Call Risk</u></p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      Perpetual bonds are often callable, entitling their issuers to redeem them
      at a specified price on a date prior to maturity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Declining
      interest rates may accelerate the redemption of a callable bond, causing
      an investor’s principal to be returned sooner than expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      that scenario, investors have to reinvest the principal at the lower
      interest rates.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;"><u>Subordination</u></p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      The investors may have lower priority of claims in case of liquidation of
      the issuer, and will only be paid after debts to other senior creditors
      are satisfied.

      loss absorption features and the bond may be written-off fully or
      partially or converted to common stock on the occurrence of a trigger
      event.&nbsp;&nbsp;These bonds generally absorb losses while the issuer
      remains a going concern (i.e. in advance of the point of
      non-viability).&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from contractual bail-in mechanisms
      requiring the bonds to be written off or converted to common stock on the
      occurrence of a trigger event, they may contain statutory bail-in
      mechanisms whereby a national resolution authority writes down or converts
      bonds under specified conditions to common stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bail-in bonds
      generally absorb losses at the point of
      non-viability.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors shall pay extra attention to the
      nature of this kind of product, the trigger events, and implications of
      such trigger before they invest.

      issuer will normally buy back the bond when financing cost goes down and
      issues another callable bond based on the latest interest rate so as to
      reduce the interest expenses.

      when the interest rate goes up so that the sales proceeds can be used to

      a lower coupon rate.

        ><strong>Key Risks associated with RMB Products</strong></span
      >
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <strong>RMB currency risk</strong
        >&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;</strong>RMB<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is not freely
        convertible at present and conversion of RMB through banks in Hong Kong
        is subject to certain restrictions.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      For RMB products which are not denominated in RMB or with underlying
      investments which are not RMB denominated, such products will be subject
      to multiple currency conversion costs involved in making investments and
      liquidating investments, as well as the RMBi exchange rate fluctuations
      and bid / offer spreads when assets are sold to meet redemption requests
      and other capital requirements (e.g. settling operating expenses).
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">
      The PRC government regulates the conversion between RMB and other
      currencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the restrictions on RMB convertibility and the
      limitations on the flow of RMB funds between PRC and Hong Kong become more
      stringent, the depth of the RMB market in Hong Kong may become further
      limited.
    </p>
    <ol start="2">
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <strong>Exchange rate risks</strong>&nbsp;– the value of the RMB against
        the Hong Kong dollar and other foreign currencies fluctuates and is
        affected by changes in the PRC and international political and economic
        conditions and by many other factors.&nbsp;&nbsp;For our RMB products,
        the value of Customer’s investment in Hong Kong dollar terms may decline
        if the value of RMB depreciates against the Hong Kong dollar.
      </li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <strong>Interest rate risks</strong>&nbsp;– the PRC government has
        gradually liberalized the regulation of interest rates in recent
        years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further liberalization may increase interest rate
        volatility.&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;RMB products which are, or may invest
        in, RMB debt instruments, such instruments are susceptible to interest

          >Limited availability of underlying investments denominated in
          RMB</strong
        >&nbsp;– For RMB products that do not have access to invest directly in
        Mainland China, their available choice of underlying investments
        denominated in RMB outside Mainland China may be
        limited.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such limitation may adversely affect the return and
        performance of the&nbsp;RMB products.

        <strong>Projected returns which are not guaranteed</strong
        >&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;</strong>For some RMB investment products, their
        return may not be guaranteed or may only be partly
        guaranteed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors should read carefully the statement of
        illustrative return attached to such products and in particular, the
        assumptions on which the illustrations are based, including, for
        example, any future bonus or dividend declaration.

      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <strong>Long term commitment to investment products</strong>&nbsp;– For
        RMB products which involve a long period of investment, if investors
        redeem their investment before the maturity date or during the lock-up
        period (if applicable), investors may incur a significant loss of
        principal where the proceeds may be substantially lower than their
        invested amount.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors may also suffer from early
        surrender / withdrawal fees and charges as well as the loss of returns
        (where applicable) as a result of redemption before the maturity date or
        during lock-up period.

        ><b>counter parties</b>&nbsp;– For RMB products invest in RMB debt
        instruments which are not supported by any collateral, such products are
        fully exposed to the credit risk of the relevant counter
        parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a RMB product may invest in derivative
        instruments, counter party risk may also arise as the default by the
        derivative issuers may adversely affect the performance of the RMB
        product and result in substantial loss.
      </li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <strong>Liquidity risk</strong>&nbsp;– RMB products may suffer
        significant losses in liquidating the underlying investment, especially
        if such investments do not have an active secondary market and their
        prices have large bid / offer spread.

      <li style="font-weight: 400;">
        <strong>Possibility of not receiving RMB upon redemption</strong>&nbsp;–
        For RMB products with a significant portion of non-RMB denominated
        underlying investments, there is a possibility of not receiving the full
        amount in RMB upon redemption.&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the case if the
        issuer is not able to obtain sufficient amount of RMB in a timely manner
        due to the exchange controls and restrictions applicable to the
        currency.

        The above key risks statement does not disclose all the risks and
        information in relation to investment in RMB products.&nbsp;&nbsp;For
        example, selling restrictions may be applicable to certain investors in
        accordance with the restrictions as stipulated in the relevant
        prospectus of the RMB products.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors must therefore read
        the relevant prospectus, circular or any other documents in respect of
        each RMB products and carefully consider all other risk factors set out
        therein before deciding whether to invest.
