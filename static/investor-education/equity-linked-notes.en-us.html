    <p><strong>Scenario 2</strong></p>
    <p>
      During the tenor, the underlying’s price movement shows significant
      fluctuation, and finally closes at 69. Since the closing price is higher
      than the strike price, investor can get back 100% of the notional amount.
      The yield for investor is 32.80% per annum.

      />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Scenario 3</strong></p>
    <p>
      Since the trade day, the underlying’s price performs poorly and plunges
      down to 65. As the price closes below strike price, investor receives
      physical delivery of shares at strike price. The MTM loss of investor is
      2.99%.

    <p><strong>Range Accrual Laggard Note</strong></p>
    <p>
      If all the underlyings’ prices stay above (at market close) their
      respective strike prices, investor can obtain the potential variable
      coupon on a daily accrual basis (exchange business days only).
    </p>
    <p>
      If the laggard underlying’s price is higher than its knock-out barrier on
      the periodic valuation date, the note will be early redeemed with 100% of
      the principal + accrued coupon; otherwise, the note continues.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case where not all the underlyings’ prices are above the strike price,
      the note may not pay coupon on periodic payment date.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
    <p>
      •&nbsp; &nbsp; The note can be priced with or without guaranteed
      coupon.<br />
      •&nbsp; &nbsp; Coupons are accrued for each exchange business day that all
      the underlyings close at or above their respective strike levels.<br />
      •&nbsp; &nbsp; Basket of more than 1 underlying can enhance the coupon
      return. Such enhanced coupon is to compensate the increased downside risk
      of an investor receiving physical delivery of the underlying at maturity
      at a strike price that is higher than market price.

    <p><strong>How to determine the coupon in each period</strong></p>
    <p>
      •&nbsp; &nbsp; Revisit Scenario 2, the first month coupon is
      guaranteed.&nbsp; No matter the closing prices of both stocks in the
      basket, the coupon rate is guaranteed to pay to investors, i.e. 4% flat to
      investors.<br />
      •&nbsp; &nbsp; In the 2nd period, the total of 25 days out of 60 exchange
      business days that either or both stocks below their respective
      strikes.&nbsp; Coupon rate is a proportion of 4%, i.e. 4% x (60-25)/60 =
      2.33% flat.<br />
      •&nbsp; &nbsp; Coupon determination is independent of previous coupon
      paid.&nbsp;<br />
      • In case where at least one of the underlying is below the strike price
      for the entire period, investors can only get the guaranteed coupon (if
      any) and no coupon thereafter.

    <p><strong>Risk of Investment and Investment Suitability</strong></p>
    <p>
      1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Investment involves risk. The price of a Derivative
      Product may fluctuate, sometimes dramatically; it may move up or down and
      may even become valueless. It is likely that loss may be incurred rather
      than profit made as a result of buying and/or selling a particular
      Derivative Product. Past performance figures are not indicative of future
      performance. The Investor should carefully read the term sheets (for
      Derivative Products) and other relevant documents for details before
      making any investment decisions, and thereafter, should regularly check
      for update of information relating to the Derivative Products.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Derivative Products are complex and involve
      different types of risks. The risk of loss resulting from investments in
      such Derivative Products can be substantial with a total loss of capital
      value. The Investor should: (a) study and understand the structure of the
      Derivative Products before placing any orders; and (b) have prior
      experience with investment in the Derivative Products and fully understand
      the associated risks before making a decision to invest in such products
      and ensure that the products are suitable in light of his financial
      position and investment objectives.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Specific Risk of Investing in Derivative Products</strong></p>
    <p>
      1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derivative Products often involve a high
      degree of gearing, so that a relatively small movement in the price of the
      underlying securities results in a disproportionately large movement in
      the price. The values of Derivative Products are not fixed, but fluctuate
      with the market, which may be influenced by many factors, including
      changes in the economic and/or political environment. The prices of
      Derivative Products can therefore be volatile.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.<br />
      a)&nbsp; &nbsp; Investors should not buy a Derivative Product unless it is
      prepared to sustain a total loss of the investment plus any commission or
      other transaction charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      b)&nbsp; &nbsp; While Derivative Products are unexercised and if their
      underlying securities are suspended from trading on the relevant stock
      exchanges, they may be suspended from trading for a similar period of time
      as their underlying securities.
    </p>
    <p>
      c)&nbsp; &nbsp; Depending on the structure of a particular Derivative
      Product, an investor may be obligated to accept delivery or make delivery
      (as the case may be) of the underlying securities if the conversion price
      is triggered or pursuant to the terms and conditions of the relevant
      agreement, contract or confirmation of the subject Transaction. Depending
      on the market conditions, an investor may be obligated to accept delivery
      of the underlying securities at a price which is above the market price
      such securities or to make delivery of the underlying securities at a
      price which is below the market price of such securities and losses may
      occur resulting from such actions which can be substantial. The loss
      resulting from investing in such Derivative Products can be over and above
      the initial amounts invested to a substantial extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      d)&nbsp; &nbsp; If there is an extraordinary event or an adjustment event
      such a stock split, issue of bonus shares or other unexpected event that
      changes the number, value or weighting of issued shares of the underlying
      stock, the counter-party/calculation agent may adjust the contract terms,
      at its sole discretion, to reflect the new market conditions. This may
      include unwinding the contract. The investor should seek independent
      advice from professional parties in the event of such extraordinary events
      or adjustments.
    </p>
    <p>
      e)&nbsp; &nbsp; Early termination prior to maturity is possible subject to
      the terms and conditions governing the Derivative Product and prevailing
      market terms and conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      f)&nbsp; &nbsp; The value of the Derivative Products may be reduced due to
      any downgrades by rating agencies such as Moody’s Investors Inc. or
      Standard &amp; Poor’s Rating Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      g)&nbsp; &nbsp; Structured products are formed by combining two or more
      financial instruments and may include one or more Derivative Products.
      Structured products may carry a high degree of risk and may not be
      suitable for many members of the public, as the risks associated with the
      financial instruments or Derivative Products may be interconnected. As
      such, the extent of loss due to market movements can be substantial. Prior
      to engaging in structured product Transactions, the Investor should
      understand the inherent risks involved. In particular, the various risks
      associated with each financial instrument or Derivative Product should be
      evaluated separately as well as taking the structured product as a whole.
      Each structured product has its own risk profile and given the unlimited
      number of possible combinations, it is not possible to detail in this RDS
      all the risks which may arise in any particular case. The Investor should
      note that with structured products, buyers can only assert their rights
      against the issuer. Hence, particular attention needs to be paid to issuer
      risk. The Investor should therefore be aware that a total loss of his
      investment is possible if the issuer should default.
    </p>
    <p>
      h)&nbsp; &nbsp; Equity-linked instruments (“ELI”) carries a high degree of
      risk. ELIs are products combining notes/deposits with stock options which
      may allow a bull, bear or strangle (i.e. trading range) bet. The return
      component of ELI is based on the performance of a single equity security,
      a basket of equity securities, or an equity index. ELI may come in
      different forms: equity-linked notes, equity-linked deposits and
      equity-linked contracts. The maximum return on investment is usually
      limited to a predetermined amount of cash, an investor stands to
      potentially lose up to the entire investment amount if the underlying
      share price moves substantially against the investor’s view. The Investor
      should be able to understand the risks he is bearing before investing in
      ELIs.
    </p>
    <p>
      i)&nbsp; &nbsp; The prices of the underlying securities of Derivative
      Products fluctuate, sometimes dramatically. The price of a security may
      move up or down, and may become valueless. Accordingly, it is as likely
      that loss will be incurred rather than profit made as a result of buying
      or selling Derivative Products. In particular, for some Derivative
      Products such as accumulators, depending on market conditions, an investor
      may be obligated to accept delivery of the underlying securities at a
      price which is above the market price of such securities and loss may
      occur resulting from such action which can be substantial. Similarly, for
      some Derivative Products such as decumulators, an investor may be
      obligated to make delivery of the underlying securities at a price which
      is below the market price of such securities and loss may occur resulting
      from such action which can be substantial. The loss resulting from
      investing in such Derivative Products can be over and above the initial
      amounts invested to a substantial extent.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Key Risks associated with RMB Products</strong></p>
    <p>
      1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>RMB currency risk</strong> – RMB is not
      freely convertible at present and conversion of RMB through banks in Hong
      Kong is subject to certain restrictions.<br />
      For RMB products which are not denominated in RMB or with underlying
      investments which are not RMB denominated, such products will be subject
      to multiple currency conversion costs involved in making investments and
      liquidating investments, as well as the RMB exchange rate fluctuations and
      bid/offer spreads when assets are sold to meet redemption requests and
      other capital requirements (e.g. settling operating expenses).<br />
      The PRC government regulates the conversion between RMB and other
      currencies. If the restrictions on RMB convertibility and the limitations
      on the flow of RMB funds between PRC and Hong Kong become more stringent,
      the depth of the RMB market in Hong Kong may become further limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Exchange rate risks</strong> – the value of
      the RMB against the Hong Kong dollar and other foreign currencies
      fluctuates and is affected by changes in the PRC and international
      political and economic conditions and by many other factors. For our RMB
      products, the value of Customer’s investment in Hong Kong dollar terms may
      decline if the value of RMB depreciates against the Hong Kong dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Interest rate risks</strong> – the PRC
      government has gradually liberalized the regulation of interest rates in
      recent years. Further liberalization may increase interest rate
      volatility. For RMB products which are, or may invest in, RMB debt
      instruments, such instruments are susceptible to interest rate
      fluctuations, which may adversely affect the return and performance of the
      RMB products.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong
        >Limited availability of underlying investments denominated in
        RMB</strong
      >
      – For RMB products that do not have access to invest directly in Mainland
      China, their available choice of underlying investments denominated in RMB
      outside Mainland China may be limited. Such limitation may adversely
      affect the return and performance of the RMB products.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong
        >Projected returns which are not guaranteed</strong
      >
      – For some RMB investment products, their return may not be guaranteed or
      may only be partly guaranteed. Investors should read carefully the
      statement of illustrative return attached to such products and in
      particular, the assumptions on which the illustrations are based,
      including, for example, any future bonus or dividend declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong
        >Long term commitment to investment products</strong
      >
      – For RMB products which involve a long period of investment, if Investors
      redeem their investment before the maturity date or during the lock-up
      period (if applicable), Investors may incur a significant loss of
      principal where the proceeds may be substantially lower than their
      invested amount. Investors may also suffer from early surrender /
      withdrawal fees and charges as well as the loss of returns (where
      applicable) as a result of redemption before the maturity date or during
      lock-up period.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Credit risk of counterparties</strong> – For
      RMB products invest in RMB debt instruments which are not supported by any
      collateral, such products are fully exposed to the credit risk of the
      relevant counterparties. Where a RMB product may invest in derivative
      instruments, counterparty risk may also arise as the default by the
      derivative issuers may adversely affect the performance of the RMB product
      and result in substantial loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Liquidity risk</strong> – RMB products may
      suffer significant losses in liquidating the underlying investment,
      especially if such investments do not have an active secondary market and
      their prices have large bid / offer spread.
    </p>
    <p>
      9.&nbsp; &nbsp;
      <strong>&nbsp;Possibility of not receiving RMB upon redemption</strong> –
      For RMB products with a significant portion of non-RMB denominated
