        <li>
          ETFs allow you to invest in entire countries or sectors while
          lessening your exposure to any single stock.

        <li>
          Full replication cash-based ETFs hold all securities within its
          underlying index.
        </li>
        <li>
          ETFs using representative sampling or optimization strategies hold
          only a portion of the underlying securities.

      <div><b>Risks of Using ETFs:</b></div>
      <div>
        Investing always involves some risks and it’s important to understand
        the specific risks to individual products. The following risks should be
        considered when investing in ETFs:

      <div></div>
      <div><b>1. Market Risk</b></div>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
          Like stocks, prices of ETF shares fluctuate due to various factors.
          The possibility of market volatility and its impact on security prices
          should be a&nbsp;consideration for any investor.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        <div><b>2. Tracking Error</b></div>
      </div>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
          Since ETFs are based on an index or benchmark, there is a chance that
          there will be a divergence in the return earned by the ETF from the
          index.
        </li>
        <li>
          The divergence between the ETF from the index can be positive, meaning
          there is profit or negative, meaning the ETF returns less than the
          index would indicate.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div><b>3. Foreign Exchange Risk</b></div>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
          &nbsp;Currency rate fluctuations can affect the value of an ETF’s
          underlying assets, thus affecting the price of ETF shares.
