    <p><strong>Digital Payoff</strong></p>
    <p>
      Payoff of a digital structure is usually a fixed amount, which will be
      paid if the predefined condition(s) regarding the underlying is met.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Barrier<br /> </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Touch / No Touch</u><br />
      ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch:&nbsp;&nbsp;Payout
      is given if the barrier is reached.<br />
      ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No-touch:&nbsp;&nbsp;Payout
      is given if the barrier is NOT reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>European / American</u><br />
      ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;European:&nbsp;&nbsp;A
      barrier which is only observed at expiry.<br />
      ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American:&nbsp;&nbsp;A
      barrier which is continuously observed throughout the life of the
      structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Single / Double</u><br />
      ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single:&nbsp;&nbsp;A

    <p><strong>Features</strong></p>
    <p>
      ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payoff amount is
      fixed if the condition is met.<br />
      ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential yield is
      higher than deposit rate.<br />

    </p>
    <p>
      1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment involves risk. The
      price of a Derivative Product may fluctuate, sometimes dramatically; it
      may move up or down and may even become valueless. It is likely that loss
      may be incurred rather than profit made as a result of buying and/or
      selling a particular Derivative Product. Past performance figures are not
      indicative of future performance. The Investor should carefully read the
      term sheets (for Derivative Products) and other relevant documents for
      details before making any investment decisions, and thereafter, should
      regularly check for update of information relating to the Derivative
      Products.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derivative Products are
      complex and involve different types of risks. The risk of loss resulting
      from investments in such Derivative Products can be substantial with a
      total loss of capital value. The Investor should: (a) study and understand
      the structure of the Derivative Products before placing any orders; and
      (b) have prior experience with investment in the Derivative Products and
      fully understand the associated risks before making a decision to invest
      in such products and ensure that the products are suitable in light of his
      financial position and investment objectives.

      >
    </p>
    <p>
      1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derivative Products often
      involve a high degree of gearing, so that a relatively small movement in
      the price of the underlying securities results in a disproportionately
      large movement in the price. The values of Derivative Products are not
      fixed, but fluctuate with the market, which may be influenced by many
      factors, including changes in the economic and/or political environment.
      The prices of Derivative Products can therefore be volatile.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors&nbsp;should
      not&nbsp;buy a&nbsp;Derivative&nbsp;Product unless it is prepared to
      sustain a total&nbsp;loss of the investment plus any&nbsp;commission or
      other transaction charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Derivative Products are
      unexercised and if their underlying securities are suspended from trading
      on the relevant stock exchanges, they may be suspended from trading for a
      similar period of time as their underlying securities.
    </p>
    <p>
      c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on the structure of
      a particular Derivative Product, an investor may be obligated to accept
      delivery or make delivery (as the case may be) of the underlying
      securities if the conversion price is triggered or pursuant to the terms
      and conditions of the relevant agreement, contract or confirmation of the
      subject Transaction. Depending on the market conditions, an investor may
      be obligated to accept delivery of the underlying securities at a price
      which is above the market price such securities or to make delivery of the
      underlying securities at a price which is below the market price of such
      securities and losses may occur resulting from such actions which can be
      substantial. The loss resulting from investing in such Derivative Products
      can be over and above the initial amounts invested to a substantial
      extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is an extraordinary
      event or an adjustment event such a stock split, issue of bonus shares or
      other unexpected event that changes the number, value or weighting of
      issued shares of the underlying stock, the counter-party/calculation agent
      may adjust the contract terms, at its sole discretion, to reflect the new
      market conditions. This may include unwinding the contract. The investor
      should seek independent advice from professional parties in the event of
      such extraordinary events or adjustments.

      g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structured products are formed by
      combining two or more financial instruments and may include one or more
      Derivative Products. Structured products may carry a high degree of risk
      and may not be suitable for many members of the public, as the risks
      associated with the financial instruments or Derivative Products may be
      interconnected. As such, the extent of loss due to market movements can be
      substantial. Prior to engaging in structured product Transactions, the
      Investor should understand the inherent risks involved. In particular, the
      various risks associated with each financial instrument or Derivative
      Product should be evaluated separately as well as taking the structured
      product as a whole. Each structured product has its own risk profile and
      given the unlimited number of possible combinations, it is not possible to
      detail in this RDS all the risks which may arise in any particular case.
      The Investor should note that with structured products, buyers can only
      assert their rights against the issuer. Hence, particular attention needs
      to be paid to issuer risk. The Investor should therefore be aware that a
      total loss of his investment is possible if the issuer should default.

      h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equity-linked instruments (“ELI”)
      carries a high degree of risk. ELIs are products combining notes/deposits
      with stock options which may allow a bull, bear or strangle (i.e. trading
      range) bet. The return component of ELI is based on the performance of a
      single equity security, a basket of equity securities, or an equity index.
      ELI may come in different forms: equity-linked notes, equity-linked
      deposits and equity-linked contracts. The maximum return on investment is
      usually limited to a predetermined amount of cash, an investor stands to
      potentially lose up to the entire investment amount if the underlying
      share price moves substantially against the investor’s view. The Investor
      should be able to understand the risks he is bearing before investing in
      ELIs.

      i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prices of the
      underlying securities of Derivative Products fluctuate, sometimes
      dramatically. The price of a security may move up or down, and may become
      valueless. Accordingly, it is as likely that loss will be incurred rather
      than profit made as a result of buying or selling Derivative Products. In
      particular, for some Derivative Products such as accumulators, depending
      on market conditions, an investor may be obligated to accept delivery of
      the underlying securities at a price which is above the market price of
      such securities and loss may occur resulting from such action which can be
      substantial. Similarly, for some Derivative Products such as decumulators,
      an investor may be obligated to make delivery of the underlying securities
      at a price which is below the market price of such securities and loss may
      occur resulting from such action which can be substantial. The loss
      resulting from investing in such Derivative Products can be over and above
      the initial amounts invested to a substantial extent.

        ><strong>Key Risks associated with RMB Products</strong></span
      >
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>RMB currency risk</strong><strong>–&nbsp;</strong>RMB is not
        freely convertible at present and conversion of RMB through banks in
        Hong Kong is subject to certain restrictions.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For RMB products which are not denominated in RMB or with underlying
      investments which are not RMB denominated, such products will be subject
      to multiple currency conversion costs involved in making investments and
      liquidating investments, as well as the RMB exchange rate fluctuations and
      bid / offer spreads when assets are sold to meet redemption requests and
      other capital requirements (e.g. settling operating expenses).
    </p>
    <p>
      The PRC government regulates the conversion between RMB and other
      currencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the restrictions on RMB convertibility and the
      limitations on the flow of RMB funds between PRC and Hong Kong become more
      stringent, the depth of the RMB market in Hong Kong may become further
      limited.
    </p>
    <ol start="2">
      <li>
        <strong>Exchange rate risks</strong>– the value of the RMB against the
        Hong Kong dollar and other foreign currencies fluctuates and is affected
        by changes in the PRC and international political and economic
        conditions and by many other factors.&nbsp;&nbsp;For our RMB products,
        the value of Customer’s investment in Hong Kong dollar terms may decline
        if the value of RMB depreciates against the Hong Kong dollar.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Interest rate risks</strong>– the PRC government has gradually
        liberalized the regulation of interest rates in recent
        years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further liberalization may increase interest rate
        volatility.&nbsp;&nbsp;For RMB products which are, or may invest in, RMB
        debt instruments, such instruments are susceptible to interest rate
        fluctuations, which may adversely affect the return and performance of
        the RMB products.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Limited availability of underlying investments denominated in
          RMB</strong
        >– For RMB products that do not have access to invest directly in
        Mainland China, their available choice of underlying investments
        denominated in RMB outside Mainland China may be
        limited.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such limitation may adversely affect the return and
        performance of the RMB products.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Projected returns which are not guaranteed</strong
        ><strong>–&nbsp;</strong>For some RMB investment products, their return
        may not be guaranteed or may only be partly
        guaranteed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors should read carefully the statement of
        illustrative return attached to such products and in particular, the
        assumptions on which the illustrations are based, including, for
        example, any future bonus or dividend declaration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Long term commitment to investment products</strong>– For RMB
        products which involve a long period of investment, if investors redeem
        their investment before the maturity date or during the lock-up period
        (if applicable), investors may incur a significant loss of principal
        where the proceeds may be substantially lower than their invested
        amount.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors may also suffer from early surrender /
        withdrawal fees and charges as well as the loss of returns (where
        applicable) as a result of redemption before the maturity date or during
        lock-up period.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Credit risk of counterparties</strong>– For RMB products invest
        in RMB debt instruments which are not supported by any collateral, such
        products are fully exposed to the credit risk of the relevant
        counterparties.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a RMB product may invest in derivative
        instruments, counterparty risk may also arise as the default by the
        derivative issuers may adversely affect the performance of the RMB
        product and result in substantial loss.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Liquidity risk</strong>– RMB products may suffer significant
        losses in liquidating the underlying investment, especially if such
        investments do not have an active secondary market and their prices have
        large bid / offer spread.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Possibility of not receiving RMB upon redemption</strong>– For
        RMB products with a significant portion of non-RMB denominated
        underlying investments, there is a possibility of not receiving the full
        amount in RMB upon redemption.&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the case if the
        issuer is not able to obtain sufficient amount of RMB in a timely manner
        due to the exchange controls and restrictions applicable to the
        currency.
      </li>
      <li>
        The above key risks statement does not disclose all the risks and
        information in relation to investment in RMB products.&nbsp;For example,
        selling restrictions may be applicable to certain investors in
        accordance with the restrictions as stipulated in the relevant
        prospectus of the RMB products.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors must therefore read
        the relevant prospectus, circular or any other documents in respect of
        each RMB products and carefully consider all other risk factors set out
        therein before deciding whether to invest.
